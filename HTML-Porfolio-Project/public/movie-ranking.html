    <h1>"The Best Movies" according to Harilyn</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all times</h2>
<hr>
<p>I'm not really into movies. However, drawing from the ones I've seen, I think these three are the best. And if you haven't seen them, I really recommend that you do.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Big Bang Theory</strong><p>
I could watch this sitcom an infinite number of times. Its witty, clever, and full of geeky references never fails to tickle my funny bones.This show cheers me up even on my most challenging days, and I can always count on its witty humour and fantastic characters to lighten my mood.</p></li>

<li><strong>Hunter x Hunter</strong><p>
This is my favourite anime yet. It is a perfect blend of action, adventure, and emotional depth. I find myself completely invested in the characters and their journey. Every twist and turn of the plot had me on the edge of my seat, eager to see what would happen next.</p></li>

<li><strong>The Great Pretender</strong><p>
    The anime was recommended by a very dear friend, and I couldn't resist giving it a try. It is the first anime I watched, which marked the begining of my love affair with anime. From the very first scene, I was struck by the catchy tune and artistic visuals, and I became hooked instantly as the intricate plot began to unfold. Ever since, I became eager to explore more anime, and it became my go-to choice over other TV shows or movies. </p></li>
